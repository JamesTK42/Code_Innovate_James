            According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
            Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
            The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

                A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
                You wouldn't get this from any other guy
                I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
                Gotta make you understand
                Never gonna give you up
                Never gonna let you down
                Never gonna run around and desert you
                Never gonna make you cry
                Never gonna say goodbye
                Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
